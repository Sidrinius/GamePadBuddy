## Features:
### [Trait Markers]
* Show markers that represent researching/known/duplicated/researchable/intricate/ornate in all bags. 
  1. Green Star: Researchable
  2. Yellow Star: Duplicated. If you have multiple same part of gears that can be researched, only the lowest level and lowest quality one will be marked as green star, others will be marked as yellow star, which will be shown in the destruction menu.
  3. Red Star: Known
  4. Orange Star: In researching
  5. Ornate/Intricate markers
* Hide researchable(green stars) items in destruction menu. Tiny list, quick desicion.

### [Fast Teleport]
* Add a 'Y' button in select location menu in map ui. you can just tap 'Y' to teleport to that location in a minute
  (still sometimes it's not working, this function is heavily depending on guild's members. You'd better have 5 guilds with a lot of online members, so you can always find one to teleport. Then you'll love it)

### [Item's Useful Information]
* Show *Master Merchant*'s price data in tooltip if applicable.
* Show *Tamriel Trade Centre*'s price data in tooltip if applicable.
* If items are gear sets, show 5 set reward on top of the tooltip, save your time to not to scroll down the tooltip anymore.
* If items are recipes, show recipes crafting prices(from MM), also show the crafted item's price. You can have a better choice how to deal with the recipe.

### [The Covetous Countess Quest Helper]
* If you are running this quest a lot, save your time for filtering stolen items that need to be laundered.
  1. Green quest markers: Items are needed in your current quest
  2. White quest markers: Items are needed for future quest.
